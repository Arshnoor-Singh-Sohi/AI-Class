Certainly! Let's break down the provided Java code step by step:

### 1. Class Definition: `GFG`
```java
public class GFG {
```
This is the main class named `GFG`. It contains the implementation of Best-First Search using a priority queue.

### 2. Static Member: `adj`
```java
    static ArrayList<ArrayList<edge>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
```
- `adj` is a static member of the `GFG` class.
- It is an `ArrayList` of `ArrayList`s of the generic type `edge`.
- This will be used to represent the adjacency list of the graph.

### 3. Static Nested Class: `edge`
```java
    static class edge implements Comparable<edge> {
        int v, cost;

        edge(int v, int cost) {
            this.v = v;
            this.cost = cost;
        }

        @Override
        public int compareTo(edge o) {
            if (o.cost < cost) {
                return 1;
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
        }
    }
```
- `edge` is a nested class within `GFG`.
- It represents an edge in the graph.
- Implements `Comparable` to enable sorting of edges based on their cost.

### 4. Constructor: `GFG(int v)`
```java
    public GFG(int v) {
        for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
    }
```
- Constructor initializes the adjacency list (`adj`) with empty ArrayLists for each vertex.
- The parameter `v` represents the number of vertices in the graph.

### 5. Method: `best_first_search(int source, int target, int v)`
```java
    static void best_first_search(int source, int target, int v) {
        PriorityQueue<edge> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[v];
        visited[source] = true;
        pq.add(new edge(source, -1));
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int x = pq.poll().v;
            System.out.print(x + " ");

            if (target == x) {
                break;
            }

            for (edge adjacentNodeEdge : adj.get(x)) {
                if (!visited[adjacentNodeEdge.v]) {
                    visited[adjacentNodeEdge.v] = true;
                    pq.add(adjacentNodeEdge);
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
- `best_first_search` method performs the Best-First Search algorithm.
- It uses a `PriorityQueue` (`pq`) to keep track of nodes in a priority order based on their cost.
- `visited` array is used to mark visited nodes.
- The algorithm starts from the `source` node and explores adjacent nodes based on their cost.
- The goal is to reach the `target` node while minimizing the cost.

### 6. Method: `addedge(int u, int v, int cost)`
```java
    void addedge(int u, int v, int cost) {
        adj.get(u).add(new edge(v, cost));
        adj.get(v).add(new edge(u, cost));
    }
```
- `addedge` method adds an edge to the graph.
- It adds an edge between vertices `u` and `v` with a specified cost.

### 7. Main Method: `public static void main(String args[])`
```java
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int v = 14;
        GFG graph = new GFG(v);
        // ... (see next point)
        int source = 0;
        int target = 9;
        best_first_search(source, target, v);
    }
```
- The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
- It creates an instance of `GFG` representing a graph with 14 vertices.
- Edges are added to the graph using the `addedge` method.
- The Best-First Search is invoked with a specified `source` and `target` node.

### 8. Graph Definition in `main` method
```java
        graph.addedge(0, 1, 3);
        // ... (addition of other edges)
        graph.addedge(9, 13, 2);
```
- Edges are added to the graph using the `addedge` method.
- This section defines the graph structure based on the provided edges.

### 9. Function Call: `best_first_search(source, target, v);`
```java
        int source = 0;
        int target = 9;
        best_first_search(source, target, v);
```
- The `best_first_search` method is called with the specified `source`, `target`, and the number of vertices (`v`).

### 10. Conclusion
- The code implements Best-First Search using a priority queue on a graph represented by an adjacency list.
- The algorithm aims to find the lowest cost path from the source to the target vertex.

Please note that the implementation assumes an undirected graph with weighted edges. The goal of the Best-First Search is to find the path with the lowest cost from the source to the target node.
