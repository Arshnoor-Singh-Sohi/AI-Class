This Java code implements Depth-First Search (DFS) on a graph. DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Let's break down the code step by step:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Graph {
  private LinkedList<Integer> adjLists[];
  private boolean visited[];

  // Graph creation
  Graph(int vertices) {
    adjLists = new LinkedList[vertices];
    visited = new boolean[vertices];

    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++)
      adjLists[i] = new LinkedList<Integer>();
  }
```

- `import java.util.*;`: Imports the `LinkedList` class and other utility classes from the `java.util` package.

- `class Graph { ... }`: Defines a class named `Graph` to represent the graph and its operations.

- `private LinkedList<Integer> adjLists[];`: Declares an array of linked lists to represent the adjacency lists for each vertex in the graph.

- `private boolean visited[];`: Declares a boolean array to keep track of visited vertices during the DFS traversal.

- `Graph(int vertices) { ... }`: Constructor for the `Graph` class. Initializes the adjacency lists and visited array based on the number of vertices.

```java
  // Add edges
  void addEdge(int src, int dest) {
    adjLists[src].add(dest);
  }
```

- `void addEdge(int src, int dest) { ... }`: Method to add an edge to the graph. It appends the destination vertex to the adjacency list of the source vertex.

```java
  // DFS algorithm
  void DFS(int vertex) {
    visited[vertex] = true;
    System.out.print(vertex + " ");

    Iterator<Integer> ite = adjLists[vertex].listIterator();
    while (ite.hasNext()) {
      int adj = ite.next();
      if (!visited[adj])
        DFS(adj);
    }
  }
```

- `void DFS(int vertex) { ... }`: Method to perform Depth-First Search starting from a given vertex. It marks the current vertex as visited, prints it, and then recursively applies DFS to its unvisited neighbors.

```java
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Graph g = new Graph(4);

    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 2);
    g.addEdge(2, 3);

    System.out.println("Following is Depth First Traversal");

    g.DFS(2);
  }
```

- `public static void main(String args[]) { ... }`: The main method creates an instance of the `Graph` class, adds edges to create a sample graph, and then initiates DFS from a specific vertex (vertex `2` in this case).

When executed, the program outputs the Depth-First Traversal starting from vertex `2`:

```
Following is Depth First Traversal
2 3
```

This represents the order in which the nodes are visited during the DFS traversal of the given graph.
